I'm a graduate student from College of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, 3D reconstruction, generative models, and medical data process.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Jiajun Bu and Haishuai Wang of EAGLE Lab from College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University.

<p style="background-color: yellow; color: red; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Currently, I am actively exploring job opportunities, including positions as an AI Research Scientist/Engineer at companies and post-doctoral positions in research institutions or universities.
